Hello, this is a test to see if the encryption/decryption works.
This is the second line, to check to see if the system prints out seperate lines correctly.
This text had a jarble of special characters provided, but for convinience of testing it has been removed.
Not because of errors but because when outputting, the display can't account for certain symbols so it provides
a weird type of text, which is at fault of the software rather than the code.
